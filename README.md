# OptimNN

OptimNN is an optimization technique for Bayesian Knowledge Tracing that uses neural networks and stochastic gradient descent to generate parameters.

To run any of the experiments, execute the file in Python. For example:

```
python optimnn.py
```

To adjust either the model variant, dataset, the neural network size, etc., please edit the configuration variables defined at the top of each file.
